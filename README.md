# Calculator Project

This project contains a simple calculator class with arithmetic operations and corresponding unit tests.

## Calculator Class

The `Calculator` class allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. The class includes the following methods:

- `add()`: Adds two numbers.
- `subtract()`: Subtracts one number from another.
- `multiply()`: Multiplies two numbers.
- `divide()`: Divides one number by another.
- `modulus()`: Calculates the remainder of division.
- `squareRoot(num)`: Calculates the square root of a number.

## Unit Tests

The project includes unit tests for the `Calculator` class to ensure the correctness of arithmetic operations. The tests cover various scenarios and edge cases to validate the behavior of the calculator methods.

## How to Run Tests

To run the tests for the `Calculator` class, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install any dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Running tests using the framework Jest is done with the command `npm run tetsJ`
